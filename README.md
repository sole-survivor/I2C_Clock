# I2C_Clock
A Digital Clock using the DS1307 RTC and LPC2129 Microcontroller.<br>
The Digital Clock is displayed on a 16x2 Alphanumeric LCD working on a 4-bit LCD Driver. The clock fetches its time from the DS1307 RTC Module interfaced with the LPC2129 Microcontroller through the I2C protocol.<br>
For now, only 2 buttons are given to set the initial starting time (MODE and SET). These buttons can be made to work through external interrupts and more buttons and features may be added in future updates.
